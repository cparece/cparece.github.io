PART 3: COLOR  (25 points)
Provide partial file name(s) and starting line number(s) for the comment in Sass for the start of each item.

11. Explain your color scheme. Did you use Natalya's work? Did you make modifications to it?
I did not use Natalya's work, I came up with my own <a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_palette.scss"> color palette </a>. I wanted the flexability to have 3 colors since I wanted my calendar to be driven based on 3 types of events (hotels, flights and activities). So I decided on a triad palette. Other than white, the only color that I hard coded was hsl(178, 76%, 37%) for my base color. from there I used the base color to calculate my accent and accent alternate. A triad palette is based off of changing th hue by 120 and 240, but keeping saturation and lightness the same. After compiling, I realized my triad color was a bit odd and didn't read the best, so I decided to tweak the lightness. Once I got these colors, I also decided to expand the palette to give me a variety of light and dark options for each color. I decided on 9 color variables for each accent. I then created a function that would allow me to easily make sure my text can be switched to light or dark depending on the background color.



ABOVE AND BEYOND (10 POINTS)
Identify what you did for Above and Beyond. Provide any relevant HTML, CSS, or Sass line number(s) and explanation of what you did. How many points do you think this was worth, and why?

I believe my above and beyond is worth 10 pointws because I did several of the items listed in the Above and Beyond section and believe that they were done very well. I even tried experimenting a bit with the scss and all the potential capabilities.

<b>Use of Sass Loops</b>
I used several Sass Loops in <a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_mixin.scss"> _mixin.scss </a>. I created for loops to crete a custom media query mixin helping clean up my scss when using media queries. I tried using a for loop to create a consistent baseline style for h1-h6 tags, so I wouldn't have to write out each tag individually. For loops are extremly helpful when I am trying to quickly generate naming conventions that would be 1 through X. I used this to quickly create the grid column and row classes. I also used a for loop to help create the mixin that would allow for me to easily create id tags without having to individually write out 1 through X that was then used to be able to expand and collapse sections within the <a href="cparece.github.io/index.html"> index.html </a>

<b>Super Dry, well-structured Sass</b>
My sass is very dry all of my <a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_variables.scss"> _variables.scss </a>. The fonts, padding, and margins can easily rescale just by changing the $base size (line 10). All of the variables are pulled out into one file, and imported as the first line in the <a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_styles.scss"> _styles.scss</a>. Then the <a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_mixin.scss"> _mixin.scss </a> is pulled in with several different mixins to help keep the scss files clean and minimalized. Each additional partial is then added to the <a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_styles.scss"> _styles.scss</a> so that it cascades properly. 

<b>Color Scheme Generation</b>
See notes on #11. 

<b>Other</b>
I found a way to expand and collapse divs in pure html and Sass by using a checkbox input and adding the proper classes. You can see this demonstrated by clicking on any of the headers on the elements with the class .dividers on the <a href="cparece.github.io/index.html"> index.html </a>. The only piece I ended up taking out was the addition of adding the ::after class for an expaned and collapse arrow because it was being buggy and wouldn't work all the time. After spending over 2.5 hours to debug, I ended up just removing that part, but it is commented out in the scss files, so feel free to comment it back in to take a look. This feature is in the <a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_mixin.scss"> _mixin.scss </a> and 
<a href="cparece.github.io/styles/_overview.scss"> _overview.scss </a>.
